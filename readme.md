 "HERE we are can use "git status" command to check where the file is staged to the or no not"
 if the new file or the modified file is not staged we can use "git add ."to add all the working files to the stage or we can use
 "git add <file name to be staged>" to add specific file 


#commiting
The changes are staged but not commited in the git so we the staged files should be commmited we will commit any file by adding a message -m 
It is better to use to relevent message for the commiting
we use "git commit -m <relvent message for title>" -m "<revelent message for description>"
